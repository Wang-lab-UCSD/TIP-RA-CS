# TIP-RA-CS
The code needed to reproduce the analysis of methylation array data in James, Holers, Iyer, Prideaux, et al. 2023.

## **System Requirements**
Script has been tested on system with following specifications:

Platform: x86_64-conda-linux-gnu
R version: R version 4.1.3 (2022-03-10)

Analysis has been performed on a high-performance cluster using the slurm job management system with at least 40GB of memory.

Required R packages are included in the below conda environment files and are loaded in each notebook.

## **Instructions**
Begin the analysis by first creating the conda environments found here: ~/Code/Environments/*.yml. 

The methylation data produced in this publication have been deposited in NCBIâ€™s Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible via the accession number GSE230446.  Please find the data at the following link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE230446. Please download the data from GEO to the directory: ~/Data/Raw_Data/

Run Analysis Notebooks
- For each notebook in directory: ~/Code/
  - Launch the notebook
      - Select the appropriate conda environment
        - All notebooks EXCEPT ~/Code/06.DMG_reactome.ipynb use jupyter_TIP-RA-CS.yml
        - For ~/Code/06.DMG_reactome.ipynb use ~/Code/jupyter_reactome.yml
  - Change the filepath of the project_master_dir to the appropriate location on your system
  - Run all cells
-	Repeat for each additional notebook in directory: ~/Code/

Note: Run scripts in numerical order.  The results from preceding notebooks are required for later notebooks to run correctly.  Please ensure that you change the project_master_dir to the appropriate location on your system for each notebook before running.

## **Mapping Results to Figures**

After running the analysis, the results for each figure can be found in these locations:
